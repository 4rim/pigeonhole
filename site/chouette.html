		<h2>About Chouette</h2>
		<div id="flex">
		<figure style="width:70%; margin:3px;"><img src="../media/chouetteref.png"><figcaption>
		The first "reference sheet" I made for Chouette. I don't really like making reference
		sheets, if you couldn't tell by how haphazard this one is,
		but by this point I'd drawn him enough to have a consolidated idea
		of his appearance and demeanor. Even so, you can see that he has changed 
		since then.
		</figcaption></figure>
		<figure style="width:37.49%; margin:3px;"><img src="../media/chouette.webp"><figcaption style="text-align:right;">The first
		time I ever drew him.</figcaption></figure></div>
		<p style="text-indent:10%">
		<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">chouette</span> was born in January of 2021. On a whim
		I wanted to make a gravedigger character, someone
		who dug up and stole the corpses in unattended
		graveyards just for the hell of it. He was made
		in tandem with another friend's character, but 
		quickly he became his own thing with his own 
		world. Though no longer a gravedigger, he does still
		hang around cemeteries.
		</p>
		<p>
		I never felt the need to go into too much detail
		with him where lore is concerned. He's a priest,
		but of what religion? Definitely Christian,
		but beyond that I haven't settled on anything
		more specific, though I have drawn him in both
		explicitly Protestant and <a href="../media/a10.png">Catholic</a> 
		contexts.
		</p>
		<figure><img src="../media/chouetteriver.webp"><figcaption>
		Said Protestant context.</figcaption></figure>
		<p>
		His childhood? Probably largely non-descript and normal,
		in some secluded part of the  French countryside.
		Brought up in an orphanage ran by nuns, somehow
		someway resolving to become a priest or reverend, and going off
		to seminary to silently raise havoc. 
		</p>
		<p>Because he was so quiet and sullen, as
		well as slow to react, many people probably
		assumed he was just dumb or sick (or both).
		Even as a child there would've been a bit of
		a reptilian quality to him, a lizard
		sunning itself on a rock and slowly
		licking its eyeball with contemptuous 
		lethargy.
		</p>
		<div id="flex">
		<figure style="margin:3px; width:45%"><img src="../media/chouettekid.webp"><figcaption>
		Chouette as a child, still offputting as ever. I actually remember being inspired
		to draw this because of <a href="https://blankmanger.neocities.org/monastery/workshop/sewingjournal#victorian-edwardian-overdress
		">blankmanger's page about
		Victorian pinafores</a>.
		</figcaption></figure>
		
		<figure style="margin:3px; width:45%"><img src="../media/chouettewafer.webp">

		<p>
		Chouette is one of my first completely and 
		genuinely evil characters. Most of my cast 
		tend to be morally grey ne'er-do-wellers, but
		Chouette is one hundred percent pure malignant
		nastiness. But you wouldn't know it just to 
		see him, because he seems timid—just a 
		terse and scrupulous young man in the vein of
		the lead from <cite>Diary of a Country Priest
		</cite> by Robert Bresson—but this guy
		is dangerous.

		</blockquote>
		<p>
		I haven't fully settled on <em>why</em> he's 
		so... <em>like that</em> but he <em>has</em>
		had delusions of stigmata and similar manias
		of messianic grandeur. One of the pivotal
		moments of his life were hallucinations
		he saw when he was in his mid-twenties,
		where stigmata appeared on his hands (depicted
		on the front page of this website).
		Unironically the late great <strong>Terry A. Davis
		</strong> has definitely indirectly inspired me
		in figuring out Chouette's pathology,
		both of them being God's-lonely-men-in-arms.
		In similar veins, so has <strong>
			Alexander Grothendieck</strong> and 
		<strong>Simone Weil</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>I've actually compiled a list of 
		fictional priests that I feel are analogous
		to Chouette's character. It includes the
		aforementioned Bressonian country priest as well as 
		Reverend Toller from <cite>First Reformed</cite>
		and the stepfather from <cite>Fanny and
		Alexander</cite>. Suffering and suffered men of the cloth,
		etc etc. There is no shortage of them!</p>
		<p>
		<h2>Other characters that remind me of, or have
		inspired Chouette</h2>
		Outside of priests, there are a few other
		characters that, inexplicably, remind me of
		him:
		<ul>
			<li><em>Both</em> Gustav von Aschenbach
				and Tadzio from Death in Venice</li>
			<li>Hugo Barrett from The Servant <small>
			oh man it's just gonna be a bunch of 
			Dirk Bogarde isn't it. Actually Mr.
				Bogarde's characters are very Chouette
				to me. I would've included him in
				The Night Porter here (along with
				his co-lead of course)
				for the disturbing contrast
				between the childish flirting
				and depraved WWII sado-masochism.
				</small></li>
			<li>Song Seo-rae from Decision to Leave</li>
			<li>A little bit of Raskolnikov from Crime
				and Punishment</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Sundry facts</h2>
		<p>
		Some trivia about him you may find
		interesting:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="pronounce">You pronounce his name like "shwet". In IPA, /ʃwet/.</li>
			<li>His favorite animal is the owl, 
				especially barn owls. He has one as 
				a pet, named <i>Modeste</i>.</li>
			<li>His name is of French origin, and it
				means "owl", though I've heard it's 
				also slang meaning "cool" or "trendy", i.e. 
				<i>c'est très chouette</i> = it's so nice.
				<ul>
					<li>I had another character
					called Chouette before, she was
					an assassin. I scrapped her
					long ago, but she also had
					an affinity for barn owls.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>He is not in fact French or of any
			explicit nationality. He probably would
			have a Nansen passport.</li>
			<li>He has a childhood friend called
				Poet. (Poet... Chouette... they
				rhyme.) I drew him/her a couple times
				and literally never revisited it
				ever again.</li> 
			<li>I think his favorite music genre
				would be pop-y and a little
				sardonic, maybe something
				like Alain Souchon's <a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=V_SNDGwwGFM">Foule
					sentimentale</a>.
			<li>He sort of has a theme song:
			Evil by Red House Painters from their
			Bridge album. These lyrics just hit
			me as being very Chouette:</li>
			<blockquote style="padding-bottom:0;">
				And when in the night <br>
				Your brother turned to me and said, <br>
				"God, do you look evil in the dark" <br>
				That made me feel good <br>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote style="padding-top:0;">
				And when on Sunday <br>
				Their daughter turned at me and said, <br>
				"Mom and dad, is it a boy or a girl" <br>
				"Mom and dad, is it a he or a she" <br>
				That made me feel good<br>
			</blockquote>
			<li>Here is the part where I try to 
				field all the basic personality
				questions:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Myers-Briggs:</strong> <span id="mbti">INTP-A</a>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Enneagram:</strong> 5w8</li>
				<li><strong>Zodiac:</strong> Aquarius</li>
				<li><strong>찍기/부우기:</strong> 찍기</li>
				<li><strong>Blood type:</strong> A</li>
				<li>A score of 34 on this autism test,
					indicating a strong possibility
					of an autism diagnosis</li>
				<li>Phlegmatic</li>
			</ul></ul>

		<h2>Analysis (kind of)</h2>
		<p style="text-indent:10%">
		<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">
			In conclusion?</span> He came about on a whim,
		but he's managed to be a near-constant
		presence in my head for almost two years
		now. I've drawn over thirty finished pieces
		of him, and countless other doodles on
		scraps of paper, God knows the number.
		A big chunk of this website is just
		dedicated to him. Like I say on the index,
		he shows up <em>everywhere</em>, simply
		because I have so many image files of him
		all stored in a folder.</p>
		<p>It's funny to think that I've 
		dedicated so much time and effort to
		something that was created by pure
		happenstance (and I wince at the thought
		of the many other characters, created with much
		more intention and planning than he was,
		going neglected in the mental cupboard).</p>
		<p>He's gone through many iterations,
		but the core of his design hasn't changed.
		Namely, the weird grey-ish dishwater blond
		hair, the freckles, the similarly
		vaguely-colored eyes, the heavy eyebags,
		and faint eyebrows, all come together
		to create an uncanny likeness
		that's always fun to draw for me, whether
		he's in a cassock or a <a href="../media/chouettefit.webp">high-fashion
		leotard thing</a>. My friend and I once 
		talked about how off-putting Chouette would
		look if he were a real person. Downright
		unpleasant, even.</p>
		<figure><img src="../media/chouettestudy.webp">
		<figcaption>
		A while back, a friend on Twitter retweeted this
		striking portrait by some Russian painter,
		and I decided to make a study of it with
		Chouette, after thinking about how he'd look
		in a more realistic style.
		</figcaption></figure>
		<p>He's a lot of things to me. He's
		Kierkegaard's knight of faith, he's
		the little kid in Le Guin's Omelas, 
		he's the <a href="./chouette-ebola.html">ebola virus personified</a>. He's
		awful and irredeemable yet a clergy
		of an infinitely forgiving God.</p>
		<p>If you've read all the way down to
		this point, and still don't really
		understand what kind of person he is,
		then great. Me neither. I just realised
		while writing this that I hadn't
		mentioned any specifics about what he
		did, what kind of crimes he 
		committed, why exactly does he 
		deserve to be called evil, aside from
		the sin of being a little creepy. I
		don't think I'll ever have a concrete
		list of it all.
		</p>
		<p>Theologically, he's a mystery too.
		He doesn't act
		like a man predestined for hell,
		but he's definitely not like this
		because he backslid. 
		Redemption... damnation...
		he is removed from that binary
		entirely. Both are out of the question
		for someone, some<em>thing</em> like him. 
		Despite everything he is simple, 
		almost childish rather than 
		conniving or manipulative. His bland
		face reveals little. He seems
		content to maintain the impression
		that he is unintelligent. His
		circulation sucks, so his hands
		are always <span id="cold-hands">cold as ice</span>. They're soft,
		like a woman's hands. Like Song Seo-rae
		of <i>Decision to Leave</i>, his very
		presence is shaded by ulterior motive.
		Does
		he even believe in a god? It's
		hard to say.</p>

		<h2>Chouette's philosophy (kind of)</h2>
		<p style="text-indent:10%"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">
		Here</span>, since you've scrolled down this
		far I might as well reward that with an
		image. Yet another thing I've associated
		with him is Don DeLillo's <i>Cosmopolis</i>.
		Here is a sketch page dedicated to
		this crossover, where Chouette is portrayed as 
		Eric Packard's assassin (bottom-left), his
		bodyguard, Torvald (top-middle), and 
		Packard himself (right). 
		Both Chouette and
		Mr. Packard are obsessed with birds, and
		more broadly, with understanding (and
		controlling) the
		world around them.</p>
		<figure><img src="../media/chouettesketches.png">
		<figcaption>
		</figcaption></figure>
		<blockquote>
		People think about who they are in the
		stillest hour of the night. I carry this
		thought, the child's mystery and the
		terror of this thought, I feel this 
		immensity in my soul every second of my
		life.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have my iron desk that I hauled up
		three flights of stairs, with ropes and
		wedges. I have my pencils that I 
		sharpen with a paring knife.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>There are dead stars that still shine
		because their light is trapped in time.
		Where do I stand in this light, which
		does not strictly exist?
		</strong>
		<div class="citation"><cite>Cosmopolis
			</cite> by Don DeLillo (bold mine)
		</div>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Both are the ultimate
		perpetrators of the old Gnostic heresy.
		<em>To know oneself is to know God</em>.
		Mr. Packard pays for this with his life,
		supposedly dying at the hands of
		his stalker with a bullet wound through his hand, like a 
		post-industrial
		perversion of stigmata. He learns that
		nothing is completely knowable,
		that chaos and mystery always exists
		not only in the margins of life but
		rather permeates everything around him,
		all the way from the rareified heights of the stock market
		down to the most intimate
		parts of his own anatomy. (Not even joking,
		a big plot point is that one of his testicles is 
		skewed.)</p>
		
		<p>But Chouette... does <em>he</em> ever pay?</p>

		<blockquote>“Abandon the search
			for God and the creation and other matters
			of a similar sort.
			<br>
			<br>
			Look for him by taking
			yourself as the starting point.
			<br>
			<br>
			Learn who it
			is within you who makes everything his own
			and says, “My God, my mind, my thought, my
			soul, my body.”
			<br>
			<br>
			Learn the sources of
			sorrow, joy, love, hate...
			<br>
			<br>
			If you carefully
			investigate these matters you will find him
			in yourself."
			<br>
			<div class="citation">Monomius in <cite>The Gnostic
					Gospels</cite> by Elaine Pagels</div>
		</blockquote>

			<p>
			When I was foolish enough to write frequent
			diary entries, I once wrote this down:
			"Sometimes I sympathize with the Gnostic
			doctrine that both the material world and the god
			that made it are evil." It seems that
			despite my best attempts at making Chouette
			otherworldly and inexplicable,
			like some prowling
			Anton Chigurh or Lorne Malvo,
			it all circles
			back to old patterns of thought like
			a whirlpool forming at a just-unstoppered drain.
			Well, you know what they say about
			pets looking like their owners, or is it the
			other way around?
