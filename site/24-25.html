<p>Take more notes, on everything.</p>

<p>Don’t be so afraid of existing in the open. Everything is a lot more transient than you think. </p>

<p>Don’t avert yourself from silence. </p>

<p>You’re not incompetent, and if you are in some things, you can change this. Prepare the best you can, but don’t worry about asking <q>stupid</q> questions. Take time to deeply consider. Apply the skills you are most confident in, wherever you can.</p>

<p>Your inability to relate to others is at least partially a function of how you present yourself. Don’t see yourself as being condemned to immutable aberrance; you’re not. Be as honest and open as possible.</p>

<p>Remember what Teilhard de Chardin wrote: <q>All that is really worthwhile is action. <strong>Personal success or personal satisfaction are not worth another thought.</strong></q></p>

<p>Remember your tattoo &amp; what Tarkovsky wrote: <q>Strength and hardness are death’s companions. Weakness and flexibility are expressions of the freshness of life.</q></p>

<p>Remember this: <q>It seems to me a sign of the presence of God, that it lies there lengthwise, and not crosswise.</q></p>

<p>David Foster Wallace told himself: <q>Not another word</q> &amp; Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote: <q>Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent</q>.</p>
