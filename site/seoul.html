<h1>seoul</h1><p>This summer was the first time I stepped foot in my birth country
without my parents. I wasn’t there alone; my boyfriend sat beside me,
sleeping through most of the nine-hour flight. We hadn’t seen each other
in just over a year. All the people I’m closest to are scattered across
the world, which is part and parcel of being an international student.
My boyfriend, who I’ll call Sam, goes to college in China, and the time
difference between us is a literal twelve hours off, thirteen after
Daylight Savings kicks in. When my day is just getting started, his is
winding down. Sometimes finding the right time to have a conversation
feels like I’m a dog chasing its own tail.</p>
<p>When we arrived, Sam got held up in Immigrations while I coasted in
through an automated fingerprint scan. As I waited for him—and it took
nearly an hour—I considered the passport in my hand. It was the first
time that it had a meaningful impact on me, apart from my family, not
just via apocryphal paperwork and vague notions of patriotic identity.
It had let me skip a line.</p>
<p>On the taxi ride to our hotel (Incheon International Airport is on an
island, about an hour’s drive away from Seoul), the taxi driver remarked
to me, “you speak Korean like a foreigner”. I had said a sum total of
like ten words, so it couldn’t have just been my pronunciation—I know
for sure that I don’t have much of an accent, and that the biggest
giveaway is that all my sentences tend to die prematurely, tapering off
into mumbling. What he must have meant was that I didn’t <em>seem</em>
Korean, which is true. Every time I land in Korea—and this sounds so
silly and superficial but it’s the truth—I’m struck by how pale everyone
is, and how everyone dresses in more or less the same general style,
excepting the more artistic and avant-garde creatives of Hongdae and the
like. I’m very obviously not cut from the same cloth, but hundreds of
thousands of words have been poured into gyopo-centred solipsism, and
I’m going to try not to contribute to it here. The taxi driver asked me
where Sam was from. “Morocco”, I replied, dazed and tired out of my
mind. “Morocco! Morocco is a great country!” I glanced over at Sam,
cocking my head—though I knew he didn’t understand. “Oh, is it really?”
Morocco had made international news last year after being the first
African nation to advance to the semi-finals of the World Cup, so I
suppose there are a lot of eyes on it lately, at least where football is
concerned. And Koreans love their football.</p>
<p>I met my grandparents the day after I arrived. They live at the
northernmost district of Seoul, a place called 동봉구 (Dobong-gu), where
I spent the first five or so years of my life, and about ten of my
summers after that. It is situated next to a ridge of mountains so green
that they look blue, and it is a world apart from the bustling nucleus
of Seoul. During the winter, the mountains shed their green coat and don
caps of snow. I only have a single memory of those white-capped
mountains, because I’m only ever in Korea during the summer. We stayed
in 명동 (Myeongdong), which is Seoul’s beating heart. The last time I
had been in Myeongdong, more than four years ago, it had been an
atrophied shell of itself due to the bleak and lean Covid years, but at
some point after I left, it had undergone a miraculous defibrillation, a
total resurrection.</p>
<p>In Myeongdong, there seems to be more Japanese tourists than anyone
else. Sure, there are plenty of people from all around the world; as we
walked through the narrow streets and squeezed past crowds in cramped
pop-up stores, we would hear smatterings of French, Russian, Arabic,
Mandarin, and of course the ubiquitous English. But at least seven out
of ten times, if you saw an Asian tourist, it was almost certain that
they were Japanese. This happened in Busan, too, where there somehow
seemed to be more Japanese tourists than in Seoul. Statistically, I’d
never been in a situation like this before. It was to the point where
when I ever stumbled over a word in Korean, or didn’t catch what the
cashier or hotel clerk or waiter had asked me the first time, they would
lean in and then repeat their request in imploring Japanese:
<em>Pa-supo-to, kudasai</em>.</p>
<p>Somehow I’m almost never assumed to be Korean while I’m walking
around in Korea, and once upon a time that would’ve been a source of a
lot of angst. At this point in my life, though, it’s just a mild
inconvenience at best and genuinely humiliating at worst (though it
rarely gets that bad). My mom constantly gets mistaken as a citizen of
whatever country she happens to be travelling in at the moment: in
Russia, people on the street would ask her for directions (in Russian!),
assuming she had Kazakh or Uzbek ancestry. The same thing happened to
her in Japan. These are all amusing anecdotes, but being instantly
clocked as a not-quite citizen while walking around in my natal city
left me feeling like I was failing a test I wasn’t even aware I was
enrolled in. I envisioned myself walking around with a name tag on my
chest: “Hi, I’m Imya, and I swear to god I’m Korean”.</p>
<p>Sam talked to me a lot about landing in China for the first time, and
then later on about his trips to Shanghai. Little things, like food
delivery, the metro and the trains, WeChat (he’s the only reason I have
a WeChat account), and how basically everything, from GPS to banking, is
mediated through it. How he had to memorize his and his family members’
passport numbers, how he still has them in his brain to this day. How
hard it is to find cold beverages. At one point on the flight to
Incheon, we watched the informational video provided by the airline on
what to do when landing in China for the first time. To me it was an
impossibly distant nation governed by a set of rules like no other, not
as infiltrated by what was in my mind, a nebulous but powerful “Western
world”. Even what might feel like petty examples, like the existence of
Douyin and Baidu, were walled off from the prying eyes of the
English-speaking internet by an impenetrable fortress: the Chinese
language. Where he lives, he says he’s constantly stared at for being
visibly foreign; sometimes strangers will even take pictures of him
without asking, which only strengthens the idea of China in my head as a
sort of hermit kingdom, a world unto itself.</p>
