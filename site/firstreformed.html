<h1>firstreformed</h1>
<blockquote>Put on the full armor of God, so that you can
make your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
authorities, against the powers of this dark world. (Ephesians
6:12)</blockquote>
<p class="has-dropcap">If there’s any movie or piece of art which has forever changed the
way I look at movies – probably even has changed my life – it’s going to be
<em>First Reformed</em> (2017), directed by Paul Schrader. Many of my
friends will know that I never really shut up about this movie, even
though I watched it about four years ago.</p>
<p>Flannery O’Connor, a renowned Catholic author, once described her
short stories as “slow-acting medicine”. That is, she wanted the
immediate impact of her story not to be so obvious; for it to linger in
your system for a long time, changing your body and mind in ways
scarcely known to you. When I saw her writing about this, I seemed to
see these slow-acting medicines everywhere I looked – stories that are
deceptively simple or sometimes impassive and obscure, but all the same
have an incredibly long half-life, the change it provokes in you only
noticeable long after the initial point of contact. <em>First
Reformed</em> is one of these stories.</p>
<p>I rarely write reviews of movies, but when I do, I often fall into
the trap of retelling the plot. So I won’t be telling you much about the
actual events that occur, at least outside of the basic premise. I won’t
even be telling you the main characters’ names, aside from the
protagonist. Instead, I’ll be talking around the movie. Namely, why I
think it has such a hold on me, some of its spiritual ancestors, and the
rest of Paul Schrader’s work.</p>
<p>To put it briefly, <em>First Reformed</em> is about an ailing pastor,
Reverend Ernst Toller, who works at a titular church and begins to
counsel a couple new to the area: a pregnant woman and her troubled
husband, who is a climate activist. The church is small and underfunded,
in stark contrast to the nearby megachurch. Notably, Reverend Toller
keeps a diary, which serves as a fairly stable vehicle for the story
until shit happens.</p>
<h3>The man in the room</h3>
<p><em>First Reformed</em> is Schrader at his most self-indulgent. It’s
one of the newest in the long lineage of “man in a room” movies that
Schrader has been working on for literally his entire career, whose
eponymous men include Robert De Niro of <em>Taxi Driver</em>, Richard
Gere of <em>American Gigolo</em>, and Willem Dafoe of <em>Light Sleeper</em> –
even Ken Ogata's depiction of Yukio Mishima in the largely nonfiction <em>Yukio
Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</em> smolders like a bruised ex-angel.</p>

src="../media/light-sleeper.gif" alt="Willem Dafoe" /> <img
src="../media/mishima.gif" alt="Ken Ogata" /></div>
<p>It is also the beginning of a much more recent trilogy that deals
with troubled men and acts of cathartic violence in a struggle against
themselves, the other two movies being <em>The Card Counter</em> (2020)
and <em>Master Gardener</em> (2022) (both, while not quite reaching the
heights of <em>First Reformed</em>, are very much worth watching on
their own).</p>
<p>Many of these movies follow somewhat of a formula, and come with
their own tropes. There’s an alienated man writing in his diary, in an
austere and poorly-lit room, with funereal voiceover:</p>
<blockquote>
	[…] He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.<br>
	<center>TRAVIS (V.O.)
		(monotone)</center>

April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which
has helped wash the garbage and trash off the
sidewalks.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><center>TOLLER (V.O.)</center> I will keep this diary for one year, twelve months and
at the end of that time it will be destroyed. Shredded, then burnt. The
experiment will be over.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>William Tell<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> restlessly tosses on his motel bed.
His journal is open on the sheet wrapped desk. The most recent entry
reads: “A young man approached me. A boy. He gave me a card.”</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>John’s apartment. Night. He writes in his diary, drinks.</p>
	<p><center>LETOUR<br>(voice over)</center> I feel my life turning. All it needed was a
direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a
direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s self-parody at this point, but I don’t say this disparagingly.
Schrader has been making the same movie over and over again,
intermittently throughout his career. Yet somehow, it’s one of the most
fascinating long-term creative projects I’ve ever seen. Coming up on 80
years old, and struggling with various pulmonary illnesses (it is
sometimes painful to hear him trying to catch his breath in interviews),
Schrader is all too aware that his next movie might be his last; in a
press conference at Cannes for his newest movie, <em>O, Canada</em>, he
remarks with his usual bluntness that “every time I’m getting ready to
die, I have a new idea”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<h3>A genealogy</h3>
<p>The movies often referenced when Paul Schrader talks about <em>First
Reformed</em> are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Winter Light</em> (1963, dir. Ingmar Bergman) <img
src="../media/winter-light.gif" /></li>
<li><em>Diary of a Country Priest</em> (1951, dir. Robert Bresson) <img
src="../media/diary-of-a-country-priest.gif" /></li>
<li><em>Ordet</em> (1955, dir. Carl Theodor Dreyer) <img
src="../media/ordet.gif" /></li>
</ol>
<p>These movies all have left such an indelible mark on the creation of
<em>First Reformed</em>, that it would be easy for even a cursory
viewing to draw direct mappings from one to its successor: <em>Winter
Light</em> depicts a priest who counsels a man tormented by the threat
not of climate change, but of nuclear war; <em>Diary of a Country
Priest</em>, well, it’s literally in the name; Schrader himself
acknowledges that the very last scene of <em>First Reformed</em> is in
imitation of <em>Ordet</em>’s very last. (More specifically, he says
that he had the choice to choose between a <em>Diary</em>-style ending
and an <em>Ordet</em>-style ending; he chose the latter. I’ll keep this
remark vague because the endings of both movies should not be
spoiled…)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what the ending is. […] God comes over to him, who
has not talked to him for the whole movie, and says, ‘Reverend Toller,
you wanna know what Heaven looks like? Here it it is. This is exactly
what it looks like’. And that’s the last thing he sees.

																  class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></footer>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, you could say that the epistolary and robotic nature of
Schrader’s man-in-a-room movies is taken wholesale from Bresson. Out of
all of these influences, <em>Diary</em> is almost shocking in its
similarities with <em>First Reformed</em> specifically, which is why I
recommend it as a double-feature. But Bresson’s other movies, like
<em>Pickpocket</em>, are firmly embedded in a similar phenotype which
probably spans back forever, traversing mediums to reach the likes of
Dostoyevsky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em>.</p>
<p>Interviews with Schrader about <em>First Reformed</em> will see him
inevitably bring up his Master’s thesis from back when he studied film
at UCLA: <em>Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer</em><a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years film has developed a transcendental style, a
style which has been used by various artists in diverse cultures to
express the Holy. […] The style is not intrinsically transcendental or
religious, but it represents a way (a <em>tao</em>, in the broadest
sense of the term) to approach the Transcendent.</p>
<footer>Paul Schrader in <em>Transcendental Style in Film</em></footer>
</blockquote>
<p>Schrader employs a transcendental style in two scenes – one near the
middle, the other being the very last – to stunning effect in <em>First
Reformed</em>.</p>
<p>All the same, I still think skimming through <em>Transcendental
Style</em> can be interesting, especially focusing on the directors you
are interested in out of the three (I’m not really familiar with Ozu,
but I very much enjoyed reading the section on Bresson). I specifically
love how Schrader draws parallels between Orthodox icons and the actors
  in Bresson’s movies.</p>
<p><img src="../media/pickpocket.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The long forehead, the lean features, the closed lips, the blank
stare, the frontal view, the flat light, the uncluttered background, the
stationary camera, these identify Bresson’s protagonists as objects
suitable for veneration.
<footer>Paul Schrader in <em>Transcendental Style in Film</em></footer>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though maybe not exactly Bressonian, Ethan Hawke, who plays the part
of Reverend Toller, captures a similar abstraction: he is gaunt and
almost always dressed in black, there is a permanent furrow between his
brows, and he is colorless and moribund even in his moments of brief
happiness. He’s God’s lonely man, an abberant samurai from a bygone era,
abandoned by his so-called compatriots. Sometimes he is incompetent and
pathetic, yet he carries himself like an arbiter, an eremite, a prophet
– and isolates himself accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="../media/ernst-toller.gif" /></p>
<p>In <em>Crossroads</em>, the newest novel by Jonathan Franzen, he
describes a main character (who also happens to be a pastor)<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> as his eyes go “wide with pain”; I
always associated that phrasing with Reverend Toller and his comical
sense of martyrdom, his barely-repressed anguish. Throughout the movie,
we see him lose his careful hold on himself, and it's unbearable to
watch someone so repressed lose the things that once defined him:
self-control, restraint, routine. Any chance at quiet dignity is destroyed as
soon as we see him in the hospital, the doctor pressing a stethoscope against
his sallow back.
</p>
<p><img src="../media/crossroads-excerpt.png" /></p>
<p>Toller’s humiliation at the hands of those far more powerful than him recalls
Mark 6:4: <em>A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and
among his relatives and his own family</em>. He is Snowbridge’s holy fool.</p>
<h3>A crisis of faith</h3>
<p>I watched <em>First Reformed</em> during a time when I was in a sort
of “crisis of faith”. I don’t like calling it that because it implies
that it impacted my life beyond just a spiritual sense; as if I was
worrying about God while brushing my teeth or trying to learn
differential equations. It wasn’t that dramatic. But I remember
distinctly that it was the “crisis of faith” apparent in the synopsis of
the movie which drew me in at first, so that I could not only empathize
with the character but also see my minor crisis be splayed out on the
screen to typically cinematic proportions and depths.</p>
<p>I’m a lapsed Catholic now, and even though <em>First Reformed</em>
wears its Calvinist and broader Protestant influences on its sleeve
(Schrader was raised in a draconian Calvinist household, and did not
watch a single movie until he was 17 years old<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>),
it still jarred me enough to attempt to find my way back to Catholicism
for two, maybe almost three years. If I hadn’t watched it, I probably
would never have considered RCIA, which officially confirms you as a
member of the Catholic Church (of course, I didn’t carry through with
it).</p>
<p>For a movie ostensibly about climate change and faith, Schrader
manages to sneak in the topics which have lurked throughout much of his
career: the main character’s son died in the Iraq War, a topic that
Schrader explicitly treats in his next movie, <em>The Card
Counter</em>.</p>
<p><img src="../media/justify.gif" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And am I trying to justify what we did? No. <em>Nothing</em> justifies what we
did.</p>
<footer>Oscar Isaac as William Tell in <em>The Card Counter</em> (2020)
</blockquote>
<p>Acts of ecoterrorism are briefly mentioned, as well as climate
activist martyrs in South America and activist groups local to New York,
where the movie is set. I like how despite the movie’s headiness, it’s
impossible to separate it from its historical context, just like how
it’s impossible to talk about <em>Taxi Driver</em> without mentioning
its Vietnam War backdrop, or the fact that <em>The Card Counter</em>’s
protagonist is an Iraq War veteran, or that the lead of <em>Master
Gardener</em> is a former neo-nazi… and on, and on.</p>
<p>In one scene, the Reverend Toller is in a conversation with the man
he is trying to counsel. The man turns to Toller with an aggrieved stare
after a long-winded rant in which he enumerates the consequences of even
just a few degrees of global warming: mass casualities and displacements
on an unprecendented scale. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
In 2010 the IPCC predicted
that if dramatic action was not
taken by 2015, environmental
collapse would be irreversible.
Nothing was done. It’s now 2017.
</blockquote>
<p>This quote might date the movie, but in my mind it is genius; it only becomes
more damning with every passing year.</p>
<p>I think a big part of why <em>First Reformed</em> has captured my
attention for so long is the space it occupies in Schrader’s body of work and
its synergies with its inspirations. This family of movies seems to give way to
a mythology whose heart contains a torch that has been burning ever since the
start of the twentieth century (Bresson's time), an ostensorium perserved in
amber. There’s so much to explore about it beyond just the movie itself, and the
movie already gives you plenty to think about.</p>
<p>When I was in high school I wrote over ten thousand words
about this single movie (though most of it was scene-by-scene analysis,
and thus even less interesting than this write-up). Honestly, I’m not
sure if I like <em>movies</em> so much as I like this <em>one particular
movie</em>, if such a difference really matters in the end. For better or
worse, I will take it with me through the rest of my life.</p>
