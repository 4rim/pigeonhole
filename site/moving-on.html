<h1>moving-on</h1><p>Goodbye, <a href="">pandoc</a>, you've served me well.</p>

<p>I've spent the last few days uncharacteristically motivated, hacking together a site generator in C.</p>

<p>Another one of those endeavours where you spend hours and hours on something in hopes of saving minutes (which then themselves, hopefully, turn into hours!).</p>

<p>You might not be fond of the redesign, which is even more austere than what I had beforeâ€”and what I had before, people were already describing it as <q>minimalistic</q>!</p>

<p>I'm sorry about scrapping the art page, though. It'll make a comeback, maybe even sooner than I assume for myself.</p>

<p><q>Why all the blank space to the right, Imya?</q></p>

<p>I dunno, maybe it's a chance to spy your reflection on the screen. The background is surely dark enough to use as a mirror.</p>
