<p>You have to stay true to yourself</p>
<p>Even &amp; especially when it's most difficult</p>
<p><q>Life without friction is life without traction</q></p>
<p>The most useless tree lives longer than all the others</p>
<p><q>Weakness is great &amp; strength is worthless</q></p>
<p>When nervous, breathe out for longer than you breathe in</p>
<p>Write, and not only when you feel bad</p>
<p>Dostoyevsky via Ivan Karamazov:
<blockquote>
    Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why.
