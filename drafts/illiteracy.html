<p>Those who are working in the tech industry: I have a question for you.</p> 
<p>Many students in computer science are not coding. There's that horse that has been beaten beyond death: young people of this day and age don't know what directories are.</p> 
<p>It seems that we have somehow produced a single generation (or a generation and a half) who knows how computers work.</p> 
<p>The priority of computer science curriculums in this day and age, the great elephant which eclipses all light in the room, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. Computer literacy lags behind, maybe for a good reason.</p> 
<p>I'm not proposing a moratorium on using AI to help write code. These tools are undoubtedly useful, letting developers bypass the tedium of so-called <q>boilerplate</q> code. But what does it mean that so many students have developed a major dependency on these tools from the start of their tenure in computer science?</p> 
<p>From my (maybe excessively conservative and pessimistic) point of view, it all looks like an echo of the parable of the man who built his house on sand. Sure, he got a lot of things <em>done</em>, very fast. But then a storm came along, and it levelled all he had.</p>
<p>What does it mean that future software developers are having ChatGPT write all their assignments for them?</p> 
<p>Or were these students not going to be so wedded to code-writing in the first place, leaning towards the jobs that mediate between clients and engineers?</p> 
<p>The future of software seemed dim before the advent of mainstreamed LLM usage. The Free Software Foundation, as essential as it has been, still is completely unknown to most people. So are publications like Low-Tech Magazine. It's easy to write them off as fringe, impractical, the tech-world equivalents of treehuggers, blue sky scienctists, annoying hipsters. Grains of sand in the cogs of the great, churning machine.</p> 
<p>What does it mean that no one is building for longevity in an increasingly precarious and strained world?</p>
