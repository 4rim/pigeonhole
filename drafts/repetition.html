<p>Enamoured by the idea that long stretches of rumination and <a href="./pig.html#math-is-muscle-memory.-math-is-sedimentation">repetition</a> with an activity or on an object could allow one to <em>make it a part of themselves</em>. Literally, if you think of it as constructing new neuronal pathways in your brain. Heterophagy, assimilation, osmosis, absorption, subsumation.</p>

<p>In Jose Luis Borges' <q>Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</q>, the titular character does this to the titular piece of literature. In Italo Calvino's <cite>If on a winter's night a traveler</cite> a character does this to <cite>The Brothers Karamazov</cite>, and also in Roberto Bola√±o's <cite>Distant Star</cite>. Not so long ago it was common practice for academics (and their progenitors, monks and clergymen) to memorize long tracts of text, before personal computers completely externalized the act of recall. In religion, which is this great metal core of things with plenty of inertia, a hafiz in Islam is someone who has memorized the entirety of the Qur'an; Jewish scholars study the Torah in yeshivot around the world; prayer is recital.</p>

<p>I think we humans have forgotten much of the power of repetition. After our long war against the evil of rote memorization we have obtained our Pyrrhic victory in schools. To hell with it; all the glory goes to deriving everything from first principles now, and besides memorization doesn't matter in the real world, where one has access to any kind of information at their fingertips via phones and computers.</p>
