<p>Lean is a functional programming language and a proof assistant. I
suspect that more people are familiar with the former than the latter;
but a proof assistant is what it sounds like: some software or a suite
of software that helps the user write formal proofs and verify their
correctness.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> such a thing is possible is far outside of the scope of
this post, although there exist rich and long-lived theoretical
underpinnings such as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard
correspondence</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typed_lambda_calculus">typed lambda
calculi</a> which one could spend their entire life studying.</p>
<p>There are a variety of resources for learning to Lean online, which
I’ll include at the end of this post.</p>
<p>But since Lean’s target audience tends to be mathematicians and
computer scientists (or both), and since it draws on a lot of deep
theoretical concepts, it’s hard to simply “pick it up” as you would a
language like Python. And, as well-written as all the previously
mentioned resources can be, it can still be overwhelming to shuffle
through the documentation at the beginning.</p>
<p>So, this post is a walkthrough where we define basic algebraic
structures and hopefully gain some intuition about formalizing
mathematical definitions. It’s by no means a comprehensive or even
functional introduction to Lean. I cover a lot of things very shallowly
and it’s my hope that this rouses curiosity more than anything else, as
you get your bearings with this powerful language.</p>
<p>I don’t assume any background in abstract algebra, and provide all
definitions. If you’ve ever read or written a program before, it might
be a smoother experience for you, but this is not a necessary
prerequisite either. It would be nice if you have Lean installed on your
computer (<a href="https://lean-lang.org/download/">the installation
page is here</a>), or perhaps the <a
href="https://live.lean-lang.org/">live-lean</a> tab open in your
browser, so you can practice writing the examples; there are also some
simple, and of course optional exercises.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-defining-variables-and-structures">Basics of defining
variables and structures</h2>
<p>Defining a pretty tame variable (like a natural number) is relatively
familiar.</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def var : Nat := 4</code></pre>
<p>Read the above as: define a variable named <code>var</code> to be of
type <code>Nat</code> (read the colon as “of type”) and to hold the
value <code>4</code>. In mathematics, the symbol <code>:=</code> means
definition.</p>
<p>Negative numbers and fractionals are similarly straightforward.</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def a : Int := -2
def b : Float := 1/3</code></pre>
<p>This is cool and all, but what about more complicated data
structures? What if we want to express a point, or a coordinate on a
Cartesian plane? Lean lets us define new types pretty easily, seen
below, using <code>structure</code>. Note that types should be in
uppercase to distinguish them from variables, similar to Haskell.</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>structure Point where
    x : Float
    y : Float
deriving Repr</code></pre>
<p>It’s reminiscent of structs in C, where a variable can hold fields of
information. The <code>deriving Repr</code> part just lets us print the
Point we instantiate, like this:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def origin : Point := { x := 0.0, y := 0.0 }

#print origin
/- def origin : Point := { x := 0, y := 0 } -/</code></pre>
<p>The message in the block comment <code>/- -/</code> is what you
should see in the Lean prompts on the right-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of different numeric types in Lean
(<code>Int</code>, <code>Nat</code>, <code>Float</code>,
<code>Real</code>, and so on. What if we don’t necessarily care what
type of number our <code>Point</code> can hold, as long as both our
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the same type? This sort of
flexibility is called “polymorphism”, and is readily supported by
Lean:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>structure PPoint (α : Type) where
    x : α
    y : α
deriving Repr
    
def intPoint : PPoint Int := { x := -1, y := 10 }
def natPoint : PPoint Nat := { x := 0, y := 1 }
def fPoint : PPoint Float := { x := 1.2, y := 54.1 }</code></pre>
<p>Try printing each, and maybe come up with a <code>PPoint</code> which
takes type <code>Real</code>. Maybe a point with an x-value of <span
class="math display"><em>π</em></span> and a y-value of <span
class="math display"><em>e</em></span>? The world is your oyster (by
which I mean the world is <span
class="math display">ℝ</span>-valued).</p>
<p>When we see a type in parentheses in the definition of a structure or
a function, we can read it as “takes an argument of [that type]”. For
example, in the above case, we see that the structure
<code>PolyPoint</code> takes an argument of <code>α</code>, which is a
type. In Lean, generic placeholder types are frequently referred to with
Greek letters. You can type <code>α</code> as <code>\a</code> into a
text editor that supports writing in Lean.</p>
<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<p>Groups are an important algebraic structure, likely the first
introduced in an abstract algebra course. Formally, it is defined as a
set <span class="math display"><em>G</em></span> with a binary operation
(or a law of composition), say <span class="math display">⋅</span>,
written <span class="math display">(<em>G</em>,⋅)</span>. The operation
which follows a few axioms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The law of composition must be associative; that is, for <span
class="math display"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em></span> in <span
class="math display"><em>G</em>, <em>a</em> ⋅ (<em>b</em>⋅<em>c</em>) = (<em>a</em>⋅<em>b</em>) ⋅ <em>c</em></span></li>
<li>There must exist an identity element <span
class="math display"><em>e</em></span> in <span
class="math display"><em>G</em></span>; for all <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span> in <span
class="math display"><em>G</em>, <em>a</em> ⋅ <em>e</em> = <em>a</em></span></li>
<li>For all elements in the group, there must exist an inverse; for all
<span class="math display"><em>a</em></span> in <span
class="math display"><em>G</em></span>, the inverse of <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span>, written <span
class="math display"><em>a</em><sup>−1</sup></span>, is also in <span
class="math display"><em>G</em></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To return to Earth for a bit, some examples of groups are the
integers under addition, the real numbers under multiplication, and the
symmetries of a triangle under composition. Convince yourself that the
group axioms hold for all of these. Particularly, what is the identity
element of each of these groups? What do inverses of elements look
like?</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click for answers (plus some handy vocabulary).
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The integers under multiplication, written <span
class="math display">(ℤ,+)</span>, are a group. The identity is <span
class="math display">0</span>, since <span class="math display">0</span>
plus any integer is the integer. The inverse of an element <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span> is <span
class="math display"> − <em>a</em></span>, since for any integer <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span>, <span
class="math display"><em>a</em> + (−<em>a</em>) = 0</span>. Since the
operation is also commutative, this is also called an <strong>abelian
group</strong>.</li>
<li>The real numbers under multiplication, <span
class="math display">(ℝ,⋅)</span>, are a group. The identity is <span
class="math display">1</span>, and the inverse of an element <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span> is <span
class="math display">$$\frac{1}{a}$$</span>, or the reciprocal of <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span>.</li>
<li>The symmetries of a triangle under composition is also called the
<strong>dihedral group of degree 3</strong>, <strong>the dihedral group
of order 6</strong>, or <span
class="math display"><em>D</em><sub>3</sub></span> (sometimes <span
class="math display"><em>D</em><sub>6</sub></span>). The
<strong>order</strong> of a group is how many elements are contained in
it. The identity is simply not flipping or rotating the triangle at all.
The inverse of any rotation or reflection is just rotating or reflecting
it in the other direction, so that you return to the original
orientation.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Given a formal definition, it is sometimes not that bad to transcribe
it, almost word-for-word into Lean:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>structure myGroup (α : Type) where
    op : α → α → α
    idn : α
    inv : α → α
    assoc : ∀ (a b c : α), mul (mul a b) c = mul a (mul b c)
    op_idn : ∀ (a : α), mul a idn = a 
    op_inv : ∀ (a : α), mul a (inv a) = idn</code></pre>
<p>But while this is a valid implementation of a group, it isn’t the
most extensible or illustrative.</p>
<p>This is because groups don’t exist in a vaccum. They are a single
part of a hierarchy of algebraic structures.</p>
<p>At the highest level is a structure that is a set with <em>only</em>
a closed binary operator defined. “Closedness” or closure in math simply
means that if we use two elements belonging to a certain structure in a
binary operation, the result of that binary operation must still belong
to that structure. It need not be associative, and we don’t need
identities or inverses or any of that. This is a
<strong>magma</strong>.</p>
<p>If we have a magma with an operator that is also
<em>associative</em>, this is a <strong>semigroup</strong>.</p>
<p>A semigroup with an identity is called a <strong>monoid</strong>.</p>
<p>And finally, a monoid with inverses is a group.</p>
<p>The higher structures contain the lower structures such that every
group is a monoid, every monoid is also a semigroup, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="../media/hierarchy.png" /></p>
<p>(There are other structures, like quasigroups and loops, each with
their own constraints, but these aren’t as relevant.)</p>
<p>We can see that it might be a better idea to take into account the
larger picture, the “family tree” of these structures, when implementing
groups. Something you might do is define the simplest structure—a
magma—first, before <em>extending</em> it to get to a group.</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>structure myMagma (α : Type) where
    mul : α → α → α
    
structure mySemigroup (α : Type) extends myMagma α where
    assoc : ∀ (a b c : α), mul (mul a b) c = mul a (mul b c)</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, defining a monoid and a group is more straightforward from
here on out, now that we have some scaffolding.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Here is how I implemented a monoid and a group.
</summary>
<pre class="lean4"><code>structure myMonoid (α : Type) extends mySemigroup α where
    id : α
    mul_id : ∀ (a : α), mul a id = a
    
structure myGroup (α : Type) extends myMonoid α where
    inv : α → α
    mul_inv : ∀ (a : α), mul a (inv a) = id</code></pre>
</details>
<p>It might be illuminating to see what the developers have done in
mathlib. Reading the source as if it were documentation can be helpful
when implementing types, even if what you’re trying to build doesn’t
exist in mathlib. But we’re lucky that most of undergraduate algebra has
already been formalized, so let’s go check it out.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">If you go straight to GitHub for the source
code of mathlib4 and find the definitions of these structures, a lot of
them will look quite empty with only a single line beginning with
<code>#align</code> as their definition. This just tells Lean to
fallback on the mathlib3 definitions, which you can still view in the <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/">mathlib3
documentation</a>.)</span></p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Group (G : Type u) extends DivInvMonoid : Type u
    mul : G → G → G

    one_mul : ∀ (a : G), 1 * a = a
    mul_one : ∀ (a : G), a * 1 = a
    npow : ℕ → G → G
    npow_zero : ∀ (x : G), Monoid.npow 0 x = 1
    npow_succ : ∀ (n : ℕ) (x : G), Monoid.npow (n + 1) x = Monoid.npow n x * x

        = (DivInvMonoid.zpow (↑n.succ) a)⁻¹
    mul_left_inv : ∀ (a : G), a⁻¹ * a = 1</code></pre>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s focus on a handful of the things
that stand out. One is that the mathlib developers also take into
account the hierarchy of algebraic structures. I’ll include the “type
signatures” of each of the structures for posteriority, though I’ll link
directly to their definitions as well. Let’s start from the bottom of
the hierarchy.</p>
<p>We can see that the mathlib <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#Group">Group</a>
<code>extends</code> <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#DivInvMonoid">DivInvMonoid</a>:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Group (G : Type u) extends DivInvMonoid : Type u</code></pre>
<p>which itself extends <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#Monoid">Monoid</a>
with the <code>Inv</code> and <code>Div</code> functions:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class DivInvMonoid (G : Type u) extends Monoid , Inv , Div : Type u</code></pre>
<p>and which <em>itself</em> extends <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#Semigroup">Semigroup</a>:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Monoid (M : Type u) extends Semigroup , One : Type u</code></pre>
<p>which (finally, we’re at bedrock) extends the generic operation <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Init/Prelude.html#Mul">Mul</a>:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Semigroup (G : Type u) extends Mul : Type u</code></pre>
<p><span class="sidenote"> <code>Mul</code> basically refers to what
we’ve defined as a magma. </span></p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Mul (α : Type u) : Type u
    mul : α → α → α</code></pre>
<p>Isn’t it satisfying to see the pieces fit together?</p>
<p>The other details that they have provided have to do with group
multiplication, i.e. given an element <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span> in a group <span
class="math display"><em>G</em></span> with operation <span
class="math display">⋅</span>, then “multiplying” <span
class="math display"><em>a</em></span> by itself <span
class="math display"><em>n</em></span> times: <span
class="math display"><em>a</em> ⋅ <em>a</em> ⋅ <em>a</em> ⋅ ⋯ ⋅ <em>a</em></span>
can be written as <span
class="math display"><em>a</em><sup><em>n</em></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Another important point is that Lean has both additive and
multiplicative groups (<a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#AddGroup">AddGroup</a>
and <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.html#Group">Group</a>
respectively). Though the same group axioms hold for both of these
types, they differ notationally, and arise from slightly different
structures.</p>
<h2 id="rings">Rings</h2>
<p>Now for the second exhibition in our menagerie of algebraic
structures. Ring theory often forms the second or third part of an
Abstract Algebra course, since defining a ring requires you to know what
a group is. Their definition follows:</p>
<p>A ring is a set <span class="math display"><em>R</em></span> equipped
with two binary operations, addition <span class="math display">+</span>
and multiplication <span class="math display">⋅</span>, written <span
class="math display">(<em>R</em>,+,⋅)</span>, satisfying three sets of
axioms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math display">(<em>R</em>,+)</span> is an abelian
(commutative) group.
<ol type="a">
<li>All group axioms hold. <span class="sidenote">Recall the group
axioms are (1) associativity of operator, (2) existence of identity, (3)
existence of inverses.</span></li>
<li>Ordering of arguments in the binary operation does not matter.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><span class="math display">(<em>R</em>,⋅)</span> is a monoid.
<ol type="a">
<li>Multiplication is associative.</li>
<li>There exists an identity in the set.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition; i.e., for
any elements <span
class="math display"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em></span> in <span
class="math display"><em>R</em></span>, <span
class="math display"><em>a</em> ⋅ (<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>) = (<em>a</em>⋅<em>b</em>) + (<em>a</em>⋅<em>c</em>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The classic example is the integers under addition and
multiplication: <span class="math display">(ℤ,+,⋅)</span>. A slightly
more complicated example is the set of all <span
class="math display"><em>n</em> × <em>n</em></span> matrices with
entries from <span class="math display">ℝ</span> under matrix addition
and multiplication. The former is a commutative ring, the latter is a
noncommutative ring, since matrix multiplication does not commute.</p>
<p>Is <span class="math display">(ℕ,+,⋅)</span> a ring (where <span
class="math display">ℕ</span> stands for the set of all natural
numbers)?</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click for answer.
</summary>
No. <span class="math display">(ℕ,+)</span> is not a group, so we fail
the additive abelian group constraint already. It isn’t a group because
there aren’t inverses; e.g., for a natural number, say, <span
class="math display">2</span>, there is no element in <span
class="math display">ℕ</span> that you can add which brings you to the
identity, <span class="math display">0</span>.
</details>
<p>Try defining a ring using techniques similar to what we did for our
first attempt at a group implementation, a sort of word-for-word
transcription. Then, we’ll check out the mathlib implementation and try
to unpack it.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Click for my (naïve) take:
</summary>
<pre class="lean4"><code>structure myRing (α : Type) where
    add : α → α → α 
    mul : α → α → α 
    neg : α → α
    zero : α
    one : α
    add_assoc : ∀ (a b c : α), add (add a b) c = add a (add b c)
    add_inv_eq_zero : ∀ (a : α), add a (neg a) = zero
    add_zero : ∀ (a : α), add a zero = a
    add_comm : ∀ (a b : α), add a b = add b a
    mul_assoc : ∀ (a b c : α), mul (mul a b) c = mul a (mul b c)
    mul_one : ∀ (a : α), mul a one = a
    distrib : ∀ (a b c : α), mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul b c)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>I use <code>zero</code> to refer to the additive identity and
<code>one</code> to refer to the multiplicative identity, since
<code>mul_id</code> and <code>add_id</code> seem a little ambiguous to
me. But in your implementation, it’s ultimately your call. You could
call it <code>pizza</code>, and although it might cause confusion to the
reader, it would still be a ring.</p>
<p>We could also extend the definition of a group into that of a ring.
We would just have to define another binary operation and its
corresponding axioms, and the distributive property.</p>
<p>So how does mathlib do it? Like before, I’ll include the type
signatures of all our intermediary structures, and the entire definition
for <code>Ring</code>.</p>
<p>Mathlib starts from <code>AddCommMonoid</code> and
<code>Mul</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class AddCommMonoid (M : Type u) extends AddMonoid : Type u</code></pre>
<p>This makes sense; we attempt to treat the
abelian-group-under-addition part of the ring with
<code>AddCommGroup</code>, arising from the more general
<code>AddCommMonoid</code>, and introduce a very generic multiplicative
operation with <code>Mul</code>, to get to a
<code>NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring</code>. <span class="sidenote">In a
ring, elements that are invertible with respect to multiplication are
called <strong>units</strong>, so a non-unital ring is one whose
multiplicative monoid does not have inverses.</span></p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring (α : Type u) extends AddCommGroup , Mul : Type u</code></pre>
<p>Then, we extend the <code>NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring</code>,
introducing associativity to make it a
<code>NonUnitalSemiring</code>.</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class NonUnitalSemiring (α : Type u) extends NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring : Type u</code></pre>
<p>Next, we extend the <code>NonUnitalSemiring</code> into a
<code>Semiring</code>, introducing a multiplicative identity with
<code>One</code>.</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Semiring (α : Type u) extends NonUnitalSemiring , One , NatCast : Type u</code></pre>
<p>And finally, a <code>Ring</code> is a <code>Semiring</code> with
negation, group-ifying our additive operator (okay, abuse of vocabulary,
since an operation does not a group make, but I hope it gets the point
across); so we extend it with <code>Neg</code> and the operator
<code>Sub</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>class Ring (R : Type u) extends Semiring , Neg , Sub , IntCast : Type u</code></pre>
<p>As expected, just like groups, rings don’t exist by themselves in a
vaccum either. Semirings don’t require additive inverses, <em>rngs</em>
don’t require a multiplicative identity (did you spot the hilarious joke
that <em>i</em> stands for the multiplicative identity, so a ring
without an <em>i</em> is just rng?), and rings also generalise a notion
called a <strong>field</strong>.</p>
<p>I think of fields as a “stricter” version of rings where the
multiplicative operation must satisfy all the properties of an abelian
group. <a
href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Field/Defs.html#Field">You
can take a look at how fields are defined in mathlib</a>. The definition
is by far the longest, since it’s the most complex structure we’ve come
across.</p>
<p>Our previous picture of the group family tree has now expanded. At
the top is our broadest structure, a magma. Our main intermediaries are
groups and rings, before we arrive at the bottom, our most specialised
structure: a field.</p>
<p><img src="../media/hierarchy-with-rings.png" /></p>
<h2 id="an-aside-on-algebraic-structures">An aside on algebraic
structures</h2>
<p>The broadest way we might classify rings, groups, fields, etc, is
with the concept of an <strong>algebraic structure</strong>, defined
simply as a set with a collection of operations and axioms. The next,
higher level of classification might be a <strong>variety</strong>,
which describe a class of algebraic structures satisfying certain
axioms. Groups, abelian groups, monoids, rings, and more all form their
own varieties of algebras.</p>
<p>Perhaps we want to take an <em>even broader</em> look, by treating
each variety and their maps as a whole. Then, we could theoretically
define maps (aka <em>functors</em>) from the variety of rings to the
variety of groups. This pushes us into the territory of <del>dark
magic</del> category theory. <span class="sidenote">See ncatlab’s <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computational+trilogy">page on the
computational trilogy</a> for a deeper dialogue on category theory, type
theory, and programming language theory.</span> I know even less about
category theory than I do formal verification, so I won’t proceed, both
for your sake and mine.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-tidbits-and-resources">Helpful tidbits and
resources</h2>
<h3 id="making-our-operator-less-ugly">Making our operator less
ugly</h3>
<p>You might have noticed when we define a binary operator, like
<code>mul : α → α → α</code>, and we want to then <code>mul</code> two
things <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> together, we don’t write
<code>a mul b</code> as you might expect, but rather
<code>mul a b</code>. This is because Lean is a functional programming
language, so the names of functions come first, then their arguments.
You might then ask, “why isn’t it <code>mul(a,b)</code>, so we can
better distinguish between functions and arguments?” This is a good
question with a sprawling answer that mostly consists of “it’s
tradition”, but there’s plenty of historical detail embedded in such a
representation. <span class="sidenote">See <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Informal_description">lambda
calculus</a> for said detail.</span></p>
<p>Anyways, <code>mul a b</code> is ugly and not very intuitive for
non-computer scientists. Also, it gets confusing when we have to write
nested expressions; see our associative law.
<code>mul (mul a b) c</code> is not the most fun thing to parse for
human eyes. Luckily, Lean lets us customize our operators. What we want
is something like <code>a * b</code>, where the operator is
<em>infix</em>. But <code>*</code> is already taken; it means
multiplication for many different numeric types. Let’s find our own.</p>
<p>It varies among textbooks, but <a
href="https://archive.org/details/abstractalgebra0000dumm">Dummit and
Foote</a> use a little star <code>⋆</code> as their group operation.
It’s cute; let’s steal it. (You can write it as <code>\star</code>.)
Simply add the one of the below lines after your definition of your
group.</p>
<pre class="lean4"><code>infixl:65 `⋆` =&gt; myGroup.op
/- or -/
infixr:65 `⋆` =&gt; myGroup.op</code></pre>
<p><code>infixl</code> and <code>infixr</code> do the expected thing of
defining an operation with an infixed symbol, left-associative and
right-associative respectively. A left-associative operator is like
addition, <span class="math display">+</span>, while a right associative
operator would be like exponentiation, <code>^</code>.</p>
<p>We put a number after the colon to quantify the <em>parsing
precedence</em> of the operator; in other, mushier words, how strongly
it attaches itself to its arguments. <a
href="https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/notation.html">More detail about
parsing precedence can be seen here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we can write <code>mul a b</code> as the much more familiar
<code>a ⋆ b</code>, and the nasty <code>mul (mul a b) c</code> has
<code>(a ⋆ b) ⋆ c</code>.</p>
<p>Isn’t it adorable? There’s a constellation in our Lean file… I see
why people rave over Dummit &amp; Foote now.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Remember way back in the beginning of this post when I said I’d link
some helpful texts to learn Lean with? Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Theorem Proving in Lean 4</a> is purportedly the Lean
Bible.</li>
<li><a href="">Functional Programming in Lean</a> and <a
href="">Mathematics in Lean</a> each tackle the two branches of Lean,
computer science and math respectively.</li>
<li><a href="">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Logical Verification</a> is a
textbook from a <a
href="https://lean-forward.github.io/hitchhikers-guide/2023/">course</a>
on interactive theorem proving.</li>
<li><a href="">Formalizing Mathematics</a> is a course taught by
Professor Kevin Buzzard.</li>
<li><a href="">The Natural Number Game</a>, also by Professor Buzzard,
offers a gentler, gamified introduction to Lean. <strong>Start here if
you’re new to Lean.</strong></li>
<li><a href="">How To Prove It</a> is a popular undergraduate intro to
proofs textbook which has recently undergone a Lean-ification by its
author, Professor Velleman.</li>
<li><a href="">Loogle</a> is a search engine just for Lean, analogous to
Haskell’s Hoogle.</li>
<li><a href="">Lean 4 Documentation</a>, the nuts and bolts. Tightly
integrated with the source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lean got its start in Microsoft Research, so it’s no surprise that
Visual Studio Code is the main tool of choice for writing Lean. It is
very well-supported. However, there are other options for those of us
who like to spend copious amounts of time on tweaking and tinkering with
our text editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">lean.nvim</a> is a plug-in for Neovim users.</li>
<li><a href="">lean4-mode</a> is a mode for Emacs users.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use lean4-mode and it works pretty flawlessly, though it is more
barebones than what the Neovim plug-in offers out of the box (and the
Neovim plug-in seems faster, too!).</p>
<h2 id="up-next-and-outlinks">Up next and outlinks</h2>
<p>I’d like to make a few more posts on abstract algebra and Lean.
There’ll likely be more walkthroughs concerned with defining
sub-structures (namely subgroups and subrings), and proving basic
theorems, like the uniqueness of inverses and the identity, which
hopefully will explore other capabilities of Lean as a programming
language.</p>
<p>When I do make those posts, I’ll put them here!</p>
<p>If there are any errors in any of the math or the programming above,
please let me know. In fact, if you have any constructive criticism at
all (I know this article was overlong, and maybe included unecessary
things), my contact information is in my About page.</p>
