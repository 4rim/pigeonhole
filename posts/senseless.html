<p>What do my website and capitalism have in common?</p>
<p>Both of their respective demises are spurred on by their internal
contradictions.</p>
<p>It’s almost been four years since I started this webpage and I still
don’t know what I want it to be. I’m tempted on and off to wipe
everything clean, or disappear (but where else could I go?).</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ll stop trying to post-hoc rationalise and categorize
everything. The blog is a blog and the bird-nest is a bird-nest. The
best course to take might be to continue uploading my writing and my
thoughts (and some day, more of my art) until they start, in their
aggregates, to form patterns of their own accord.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I would’ve liked this website to be a more polished
reflection of me and my technical interests, maybe even something to put
on my resume. Yes, like one of those <em>Github pages</em>. But as it
stands now, it’s difficult for me to imagine letting people I know in
real-life have the link to this site—even though I know very few will
read past the first handful of words of anything.</p>
<p>Clearly, this website isn’t a very good educational resource. The
expository posts I <em>have</em> written don’t go very deep; they’re
scattered across the website without rhyme nor reason; I’m not really an
accredited authority of anything I’ve written about.</p>
<p>But neither is this website a proper journal or diary; my posts are
too sporadic, too postured or tortured, partly because I’m most inclined
to write when I feel bad (so…most of the time), thus everything is
tinged with a sour aftertaste: the author’s own sense of
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>But what drew me to Neocities was (and what keeps me on here is) the
sincerity of so many websites. It’s so rare to find people anywhere that
believe that they have something meaningful to say; even rarer to find
people that actually <em>do</em>. Even if they’re trying to sound cool,
or putting on airs, the fact that they pitched their tent when they
clearly didn’t have to—when it’s so much easier not to—I don’t know, I’m
so glad I found this place when I did. I feel as if my life would be
emptier if I didn’t know some place like Neocities existed.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll keep writing. I’ll stick around. The worst thing that
could happen is that I’ll still hate my website come 2026 (incidentally,
the year I graduate college). Maybe then I could finally leave, <em>give
the whole thing up</em>, knowing that I tried and failed, slapping a big
fat <em>do not resuscitate</em> sticker over the site directory on my
hard drive.</p>

possibly die? Anything that dies has had some kind of aim in life, some
kind of activity, which has worn out; but that does not apply to
Odradek. Am I to suppose, then, that he will always be rolling down the
stairs, with ends of thread trailing after him, right before the feet of
my children, and my children’s children? He does no harm to anyone that
one can see; but the idea that he is likely to survive me I find almost
painful. <footer>Franz Kafka, <em>The Cares of a Family
