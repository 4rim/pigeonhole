<div class="blurb">This post will likely be an indefinite
work-in-progress, and many things will be subject to change. It's also way too

<p>This post is inspired by suboptimalism’s <a
href="https://suboptimalism.neocities.org/writings/japanese">learning
japanese: the suboptimalist perspective</a>, which I highly recommend
you go and read, even if you’re not learning Japanese; if he had written
about learning Russian then I would’ve never thought to write this
post.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, I hope I am correct in assuming you clicked on this because you
want to learn Russian.</p>
<p>To your average English-speaker, to your average American, what is
the Russian language? Perceptions range over all sorts of cultural
stereotypes and vignettes: the mafia, the Cold War, the current invasion
of Ukraine, babushkas and gopniks and cossacks, the rise and fall of the
Soviet Union, the Space Race, oligarchs and monarchs and despots,
pumpjacks drilling for oil in the Siberian hinterland, the umbilical
land-bridge that once girded the Bering Strait, conveying the
first Americans ever to live in their New World.</p>
<p>Despite all this, and more, the online Russian-learner community
still pales in presence to that of Japanese. It does not have anything
close to the same contemporary pop-cultural presence, nor the
infrastructure of pinpoint-accurate dubs and subs, nor the specialised
sentence-mining software with tried-and-true pipelines, not even the
general appeal of animanga.</p>
<p>Even in the present-day, many resources for learning Russian have
direct predecessors in material written by and for CIA employees, with
textbook sentences as dry as “I’m scared of terrorists” and “George Bush
is the president of the USA”. It’s probably not as dire as learning,
say, Pashto, but there’s something anachronistic and anemic about it
all…</p>
<p>Most Russian learners get into it due to their family being
Russian-speakers, for diplomatic reasons, because they “want to read
Russian literature in the original”, for history-nerd reasons, or
because they’re enthusiastic about other parts of Russian culture (which
could be a good or very bad thing, depending on the part). None of these
are mutually exclusive, by the way.</p>
<p>Personally, I started learning Russian because one of my best friends
is Kazakh and relatedly, I have a long-standing obsession with Central
Asia and Siberia. When I was ten years old a Mongolian classmate wrote
my name in block Cyrillic for me, and at that moment it all clicked into
place (just kidding). But seriously, maybe I should be learning Kazakh,
and thus join the straggling ranks of the world’s marginal <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages">Ural-Altaicists</a>…</p>
<p>But the picture I’ve painted so far seems grim. What Russian <em>does</em>
have going for it is that it’s the second-most used language on the internet;
outside of great works of literature and film, many technical texts have been
written in Russian, and once upon a time Russia was very much an artistic and
cultural (and OK, STEM) powerhouse. In some respects they still are. It’s still
spoken as a major language in a handful of East European countries, the
post-Soviet nations of Central Asia, and in a smattering of enclaves in the
Americas and the Middle East. Almost everywhere you go, you can hear Russian—a
by-product of their historical status as world superpower.</p>
<p>Some people think it sounds beautiful, or even “sexy”. Yeah, maybe if
you’re used to the flaccid and rhotic sursurration of English, anything
else would sound more interesting, even the comic gutturals of
Dutch.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways, <a
    href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/a-truly-foreign-language">English
    barely exists</a>. Its vestigial case
system, which is only found in pronouns and the possessive form of
apostrophe ’s’es (yes, that’s English’s genitive case!), feels like
nothing at all when compared to that of German (whose own case system
has eroded over time), or even that of Swedish, whose case system is
even more edgeless than German’s. Yet, Swedish still employs in modern
speech its equivalents of “thither”, “hither”, and “whither” (in
Russian, туда, сюда, and куда respectively), while in English these have
all collapsed back into “there”, “here”, “where”. A few people doggedly stick
to using “whom” properly, though most view it as the archaicism that it is, and
mock it with terminally-online exclamations of “whomst’d’ve’s”. We all know it:
English has no self-respect. It’s too big and rareified to even pretend
to: English has no Académie Française, no Real Academia Española.</p>
<p>So, sometimes the appeal of learning Russian is the moments where you
can spy <a href="./standalone/idiot-sa">a glimmer of raw history through
the unassuming surface</a>. In many instances, there is a clear logic.
The word for plant, растение, is related to the verb “to grow”, расти. A
plant is then literally “something that grows”. The word for
“inspiration”, вдохновение, is a calque of the Ancient Greek
<em>ἔμπνοια</em>, which begat the Latin <em>inspiro</em>, which of
course begat the English “inspiration”. Then as expected, the morpheme
<em>в-</em> means “in”, <em>-дох-</em> is a stem related to “breath”,
and we have the <em>-ение</em> which signifies a noun. Inspiration is
“something that is like a breath inside of you”.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of words in the Russian lexicon which can’t be
broken down and digested. These words come in a variety of different
flavors—arising from Old Church Slavonic, or the Turkic peoples (the
Tuvans, the Sakhas…), or the Mongols, or those of the Caucasus (the
Avars, the Nakhs…)—words spoken by the highlanders of the 14th century,
Orthodox missionaries of the 9th, reindeer-herding tribesmen of the
17th.</p>
<p>There might be excitement in drawing lines to the familiar, but there
is just as much in finding the totally unfamiliar. I apologise if I’m
exotifying what is a completely reasonable history, but it’s
mind-boggling to consider the vastness of it all, in space and in time
and in the millions of lives of those speakers on horseback, beneath a
pale, bare, and impossibly remote sky.</p>
<p>The Turkic words, in particular, leap out at you like a sore thumb.
You look at them and think, “there’s no way this is Slavic or Latin or
Ancient Greek”. Сундук (box), деньги (money, which originates from
Mongolic <em>teng</em> which itself originates from Chinese 等),
карандаш (pencil), and many more. Sometimes they’ll even sound
<em>Korean</em>. I see why the Ural-Altaic theory was so tempting to
believe in.</p>
<p>One word I love from Russian, with purely Slavic origins, is the word
край, which usually means “edge”, but also is a specific word meaning
“territory”, in the sense of an official, administrative division of
land. Every territory—even one at the heart of the country—is somehow
also an edge, everything on the horizon approaching a limit just out of
view. That’s how vast the landmass we call Russia really is. What’s
more, ancient Slavonic words like край or река (meaning “river”) decline
in certain ways that let you know that you are using words from a
thousand-plus years ago, acting in different grammatical ways from their
“younger” compatriots.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided to learn Russian, you’ve voluntarily taken the
first step onto road less traveled. But this is only the beginning. Like
learning any other language, it requires you to channel “deep autistic
energies” (thank you suboptimalism for the apt words), i.e. a
willingness to bash your head against the wall in the face of seemingly
minimal and at times <em>actually</em> minimal progress.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned this on my blog before, but one of the perennial and
unhelpful types of post which plagues r/Russian (maybe I shouldn’t be
ragging on them so much, it <em>is</em> Reddit after all) is the
tendency for learners to seek easy gratification by posting a photo of
their Russian cursive handwriting.</p>
<p>(There is a sort of internet mythos surrounding Russian cursive due
to the meme that makes the rounds of someone’s handwritten лишишь or
шиншилла, which looks like a bunch of conjoined cursive u’s. It’s like
if you were to write “minimum” in English cursive.)</p>
<p>Almost invariably, there will be some well-meaning native speaker who
comments, “your handwriting looks better than mine, and I’m a native
speaker!” Yeah, it looks better for the same reason a precocious
five-year-old’s handwriting will look better than the handwriting of
some random twenty-something-year-old you drag off the street. Not
exactly a compliment.</p>
<p>I can’t tell what’s worse, the cursive handwriting posts or the posts
that ask, “can I just not learn cursive and write everything in block
letters?” Like, I don’t know man, not wanting to know how to handwrite
the language you supposedly want to learn to a significant level is a
weird hill to die on, and doesn’t portend well for you. If I were a mod
on r/Russian, I would simply perma-ban anyone who makes a post with some
variant of “handwriting” in the title. Anyways…</p>
<h3 id="you-should-be-reading-a-lot.">You should be reading a lot.</h3>
<p>I’ll repeat myself: you should be reading a lot.</p>
<p>The information density of pure text is hard—just about impossible—to
find anywhere else, so you’ll get the most bang for your buck just by
reading things: Wikipedia articles, news, game dialogue, the nutritional
label on a bottle of kvass… and so on.</p>
<p>However, reading is also the activity with the highest barrier of
entrance: you’ll probably need to know a couple thousand words to read
even a young-adult novel without having to look a word up every other
sentence. Even a children’s storybook is nothing to scoff at.
(Sometimes, the archaic vocabulary/constructs used in them makes them
even more difficult to parse.) The good news is that once you start
reading, every proceeding book, or article, or comic will become much
easier of an experience, sort of following a snowball effect. Getting
started will be painful, however. See the deep autistic energy that I
cited a few paragraphs ago; this is where a lot of it comes into
play.</p>
<p>Another important note: you have to get used to not understanding
50%, maybe even 75% or higher of what you’re reading, and then at some
point you just have to push on despite the ignorance clouding your
comprehension.</p>
<p>Of course, probably don’t read <em>Crime and Punishment</em> in the
original if you’re having trouble keeping up with the subtitles on a
kid’s TV show. But I’ve found that reading a novel where I understood on
average ~60%-70% of what was going on to be a relatively OK experience.
I think some people are just going to have a naturally higher tolerance
of uncertainty than others, but you can certainly train yourself to
raise it just by reading more. This discomfort is a necessary stage.</p>
<p>One of the main downsides to reading a lot is that Russian has
somewhat unpredictable stresses on words, much like English does. Unlike
Polish, which reliably has the stress on the penultimate syllable, or
Korean, which doesn’t have stress at all, it’s very possible to learn an
incorrect pronunciation of a word—I’ve done this many times. To make
things slightly more confusing, many texts won’t delineate between two
similar-looking, but very different-sounding letters—“е” and “ё”, which
sound like “ye” and “yo” respectively—which can dramatically change the
pronunciation and stress of the word. After a while it becomes slightly
easier to predict when it is an е versus when it is a ё, but it can
still set you up for an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p>If you get the stress wrong, Russians could probably still understand
you with some difficulty, but try say<strong>ing</strong> a
sent<strong>ence</strong> in Eng<strong>lish</strong> such that the
stress on eve<strong>ry</strong> word falls on the wrong
syl<strong>la</strong>ble where pos<strong>si</strong>ble. It’s quite
awkward at best, and incomprehensible at worst.</p>
<h3 id="about-russian-grammar">About Russian grammar</h3>
<p>Just like how many immersion-fiend Japanese learners will recommend
that you go through a basic Japanese grammar crash-course (e.g. Tae
Kim’s) before starting immersion in the language, you can’t (or, really,
<em>shouldn’t</em>) forego explicitly learning grammar for Russian. If
you’re learning Russian you know that it has a lot of peculiarities,
like the complex (compared to English) case system, verbs of motion,
verbal aspect, and participles. Almost every word is declined in some
way, shape or form, aside from the prepositions, which in turn have
their own idiosyncrasies that are quite different from English
prepositions.</p>
<p>It’ll be a lot less painful for you if you go into immersion knowing
at least the mechanics of the case system and verbal aspect beforehand.
Like many other things in life it sort of follows a Pareto law in which
knowing about 20% of the thing allows you to glean the remaining 80%
<em>much</em> more easily.</p>
<p>You don’t need to know every conjugation and declension, just know
that these grammatical constructs are a thing, and what they signify.
You can absorb the details and the exceptions on the go.</p>
<p>For learning these types of things, I really like Dr. Mark Pettus’s
<a href="https://www.russianthroughpropaganda.com">Russian Through
Propaganda</a> textbook series, which is pretty much unmatched in terms
of quality and contains many interesting nuggets about Russian history
and culture.</p>
<p>There is also a free online textbook called <a
href="https://mezhdunami.org/">Mezhdu Nami</a>, which is quite
comprehensive and could take you to a level with which you can start
immersing with “real” content.</p>
<p>The main sort of “modules” that comprise Russian grammar (from a
self-learner’s limited point of view) seem to be (roughly in this
order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Verb tenses/aspect</li>
<li>Verb (in)transitivity</li>
<li>Cases (not plural): usually nominative, genitive/accusative first,
then dative, instrumental and locative
<ul>
<li>Plural forms of dative, instrumental, locative</li>
<li>Plural genitive (since it can be irregular, it’s likely the most
difficult case to get the hang of)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Verbs of motion</li>
<li>Prefixed verbs of motion</li>
<li>Moods (conditional and imperative)</li>
<li>Participles (past, present, active, passive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Undoubtedly, there are a lot of other details I’m skimming over (like
the genitive of absence, or superlatives), but these are the most
general ones that immediately come to mind, and probably your average
broad-strokes look at a two-year college Russian language course.</p>
<p>If you know all these things exist (maybe aside from verb
transitivity, which you can divine on-the-go), and vaguely how they
work, you’re in a pretty good place and you can focus on exclusively
building vocabulary, which ultimately reinforces the intuition behind
these concepts without you having to get into the nuts and bolts of
them.</p>
<p>There’s a sort of phenomenon, not unique to Russian, where you’ll get
to a point where you can understand a fancily-worded but syntactically
simple sentence, e.g., “The organization established the first
geothermal plant at the edge of the city.” “Учреждение основанил первый
геотермальной завод на краю города.” <em>However</em>, it’ll be much
harder to understand a phrase that is composed of simple words yet
nevertheless communicates something more abstract, like: “He was back
and stronger than ever.” “Он вернулся и сильнее, чем когда бы то ни
было”. Especially the second part of that sentence.</p>
<p>“Than ever” is a peculiar construction in both languages. I mean,
what is “ever” in English? Similarly, “когда бы то ни было” makes no
sense when literally translated. You can see that all the words are
quite short, and all of them are quite simple, being words that you’d
probably learn in your first month of Russian classes. But in their
aggregate, in this particular order, it’s gibberish to me—translated
literally, the gloss looks like “when would neither was”, but it plays
the same role as the amorphous “ever” in the English sentence. In cases
like these, you just have to learn the entire Russian phrase as a
morphological chunk, without getting too caught up on what each
individual word is doing.</p>
<p>A common mistake that many learners (including me) tend to make is
proscribing the grammatical structures of their native language onto
their target language. Maybe since Russian doesn’t look as foreign as
languages like Japanese or Arabic, and the word order is somewhat
similar some of the time (if you squint your eyes really hard), it’s
easier for speakers of Germanic or Romance languages to get caught up on
certain Russian-isms. Why, in Russian, do we say в пятницу (“in” Friday)
and not на пятницу (“on” Friday)? And why is it the accusative case
(пятницу) instead of the expected prepositional case (пятнице)? You
could come up with hundreds, if not thousands of these arbitrary
questions. They have no real answer.</p>
<h3 id="some-helpful-resources">Some helpful resources</h3>
<p>For those who are curious about what tools have been helpful in
learning this language, here is a list of some software that I’ve used,
and some that I still use.</p>
<p>Although, success in language learning is not really a function of
what kind of app you have installed on your device, but I’m sure (at least, I
hope!) you’re well aware of that at this point. I love provocative-sounding
simplifications, so I'll say that language learning is mainly a function of how
much you read. Now there might be some tools which make reading a little less
painful.</p>
<h4 id="lingq-free-trial"><a href="https://www.lingq.com/en/">LingQ</a>
(free trial)</h4>
<p>Steve Kaufmann’s (YouTuber known for speaking many languages)
brainchild. He shills it in every video, and perhaps he deserves to; he
uses it himself. You can’t really do much with the free version. There’s
nothing that I can do in the paid version that I can’t already do now
with my own tools. I don’t recommend <em>against</em> paying for LingQ,
but I don’t really see much point in it, especially since free software
exists that does the same things as LingQ. However, if you think you’re
going to consistently use it, there’s nothing wrong with paying for a
subscription. Many people have found it beneficial.</p>
<h4 id="language-reactor-free-trial"><a
href="https://www.languagereactor.com/">Language Reactor</a> (free
trial)</h4>
<p>Only available on Chromium-based browsers. Basically helps you to
sentence-mine and create flashcards easily via subtitles on YouTube and
Netflix. There is a paid version which you need to have to access all of
the features. I can see this being very helpful for someone with a
different workflow and preferences than me. As far as I know there is no
alternative free software (for Russian, at least).</p>
<h4 id="anki-free"><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
(free)</h4>
<p>I know it’s somewhat of a meme, but Anki really works for me in
helping to learn vocabulary. I see it as working a compromise—it’s not
practical for me to be immersed in Russian literally all day, so the
natural (and perhaps more superior quality) spaced repetition that comes
from constant ambient exposure doesn’t really happen. With Anki, though,
I can try my best to simulate this exposure.</p>
<p>If you for some reason don’t want to use Anki, there are several
other spaced-repetition alternatives like Mnemosyne and SuperMemo. Or,
you can always use physical flashcards and schedule them manually.</p>
<h4 id="kiwix-free"><a href="https://kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a>
(free)</h4>
<p>Kiwix enables you to have an offline search engine. Download
Wiktionary files (for both the English and Russian versions) and you’ve
got yourself a dictionary stored locally on your device. I think I’ve
also downloaded parts of Russian Wikipedia as well, just for reading’s
sake.</p>
<h4 id="dictionariestranslators-all-free">Dictionaries/Translators (all
free)</h4>
<p>By far, I’ve used the English language Wiktionary the most, but I’m
currently in the process of trying to transition into using dictionaries
written in Russian.</p>
<p>In this case, I either use the Russian language Wiktionary, <a
href="https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C:%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0">Викисловарь</a>,
or the ever-helpful <a href="https://gramota.ru">gramota.ru</a>, which
is a sort of meta-dictionary you can use to search multiple dictionaries
at once. On gramota, I like to search the Большой толковый русский
словарь.</p>
<p><span class="blurb">N.B.: There does exist a sort of “dictionary
vocabulary” that is useful to know before you dive into monolingual
dictionaries. Words like “noun”, “adjective”, “tense” and the names of
the different cases should be helpful to learn explicitly, as they don’t
often show up outside of an academic or dictionary context.</span></p>
<p>Honestly, <a href="https://context.reverso.net">Reverso’s context
feature</a> is unparalleled in its usefulness. It gives you plenty of
sentences to mine from, and helps fine-tune your intuition of how a word
can be used. It also identifies more colloquial/slang-y usages of words
that official dictionaries might miss out on. I’m sure websites like <a
href="https://glosbe.com/">glosbe</a> and <a
href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a> are quite similar.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I will know every word in the sentence, but still have
no idea of what the sentence actually means. In these desperate times, I
like to use the <a href="https://translate.yandex.ru/">Yandex
Translator</a> as a last resort.</p>
<p>If <em>that</em> doesn’t work, then… it’s useful to know a
Russian-speaker for those dire situations.</p>
<p>I haven’t personally used it much, though I have them downloaded, but
I hear that <a href="http://www.goldendict.org/">GoldenDict</a> and <a
href="https://learning-with-texts.sourceforge.io/">LWT</a> are very
useful (and open-source) software for sentence mining and looking up
definitions.</p>
<p>Be warned, though: as deep as the goodie bag of language-learning
software is (yes, even the open-source subset), the best methodology is
the one you’ll stick to using over a long period of time.</p>
<p>For me, this is usually the method requiring a minimal amount of
activation energy; i.e., the simplest, most tried-and-true methods
possible. In my case it looks like Anki, and reading books or other
pieces of writing online. Lingq and the rest of the above are helpful,
but by no means are they the end-all-be-all. I mention them mainly
because I know that people have found success with them (here we must
note, at least for one moment, the glaring absence of Duolingo) and
because preferences/habits differ wildly from person to person.</p>
<h4 id="movies-tv-shows-streaming">Movies, TV shows (streaming)</h4>
<p>I haven’t watched many TV shows. Literally the only one I’ve ever
watched consistently is Smeshariki (Смешарики), an animated kids show
whose episodes are available on YouTube (no subtitles, sadly, I have to
deal with the inaccuracy of the auto-generated ones). Apparently it’s
kind of like Russian Bluey: ostensibly a kids show that keeps taking its
hat off to any adults that might be watching.</p>
<p>You probably already know this if you’re learning Russian, but
Mosfilm has an official channel on Youtube and they upload their
full-length movies on there. Only a few of them, however, have Russian
subtitles. I’ve found it pretty difficult to get Russian subtitles in
general. For whatever reason, there are little to no closed captions on
anything. Also, it’s funny—on some websites, there will be Ukrainian or
Polish subtitles but not Russian ones, despite the latter being spoken
by way more people. Maybe it’s some petty cultural sanction—I have no
clue.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inoriginal.ru">inoriginal.ru</a> - <em>no Russian
subtitles last time I checked</em></li>
<li><a href="https://movieuniverse.se">movieuniverse.se</a> -

<li><a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a> - <em>often Russian

</ul>
<p>I also enjoyed watching the Russian dubs of Studio Ghibli movies.
Many things can be pirated much more easily in Russian than in English
due to the virtual nonexistence of copyright law in Russia. This is one
of the many wonders you encounter when learning Russian.</p>
<h4 id="youtubers">YouTubers</h4>
<p>These are the channels whose videos I’ve enjoyed at least once. I
don’t watch that much YouTube, though. Maybe less than an hour’s worth
per week. I really should be listening more…</p>

<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flibusta.site/">flibusta.site</a> is all you need
for ebooks</li>
<li><a href="https://libgenesis.net/">Library Genesis</a> (mainly for
textbooks, like the Mark Pettius one I mentioned earlier)</li>
<li><a href="https://deti-online.com">deti-online</a> for children’s
stories</li>
</ul>
<p>In general it’s quite easy to find free ebooks by appending “читать
онлайн бесплатно” to the book title as a search query. Once again, the
lack of copyright regulation in Russia is good news for us learners.</p>
<p>I have Olly Richards’ <em>Learn Russian Through Short Stories</em>
for intermediate learners, and though I like the concept, I don’t like
the book itself as much. The stories aren’t very interesting, the
vocabulary feels arbitrary and at times even clunky. I don’t draw a hard
line at material that isn’t “by natives for natives”, but Richards’ book
just doesn’t appeal to me.</p>
<h4 id="mangacomics">Manga/comics</h4>
<p>These are <em>much</em> less information-dense than novels/short
stories, so it’s quite good for people who are just starting out
reading. In many ways easier than reading children’s stories. Most are
basically just the dialogue, and the visuals help as context clues.
Simple, slice-of-life and relatively narrative-less manga like
Yotsuba&amp;! are quite nice and easy to start out with. Meanwhile,
fantasy manga will come with their own host of vocabulary to learn,
e.g. words related to combat, magic, etc, so be warned.</p>

</ul>
<p>I’d imagine you could graduate from manga to reading light novels,
which are easier to read than regular novels. I haven’t personally read
any light novels but I know a Russian learner (Attenius) has (I’ve
linked his blog above), and he’s found them very helpful.</p>
<h4 id="music">Music?</h4>
<p>It’s good to be in contact with the language beyond just reading and
mining sentences—for example, to know more about the culture, listening
to their music is a good start. As a beginner, it helped me to learn a
lot of words and got me accustomed to some grammatical structures, some
more helpful than others. Just be aware that the sentences found in
lyrics can seem strange to directly use in everyday speech.</p>
<p>Bands like the ever-popular Kino tend to have sparse, repetitive
lyrics, (most of the Russian “doomer rock” that’s been trendy nowadays
follows in the same vein) while others are more dense. Rap is probably
going to be the most dense.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn’t really count time spent listening to music in the
language as time spent “studying” the language. Mainly because it tends
to be so informationally sparse (unless it’s rap), you’re much better
off listening to a podcast or video. Or even better, reading.</p>
<h4 id="other">Other</h4>
<p>These are mainly reading materials, as that’s my preferred way of
interacting with Russian. I tend to haunt these websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://meduza.io">meduza</a> and <a
href="https://tvrain.tv">tvrain</a> - independent news, both are known
for their anti-Russian-Federation slant</li>
<li><a href="https://diary.ru/">diary.ru</a> - neocities-esque personal
blogs</li>
<li><a href="https://dvach.ru">dvach</a> - imageboard, 4chan
analogue</li>
<li><a href="https://key.br">key.br</a> - learn how to touch type in
Russian, it will make your life as a Russian learner so much easier</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://vk.com">VK (ВКонтакте)</a> and <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> (i.e., Живой Журнал.
Did you know it is Russian-owned?).</p>
<p>Sometimes I will paste in a few paragraphs from an article/book I’m
reading, and practice typing it out. It might sound insane, but it’s
weirdly therapeutic.</p>
<p>Telegram channels are similar to personal blogs. Many online creators
and public figures in general have one of them, though normal people can
keep their friends updated with these personal channels as well.</p>
<p>Turning my phone’s language to Russian has been mildly helpful. I
know that this too is sort of a meme, but it really cements some
vocabulary into your head—words like the days of the week and months,
alarms, notifications, webpage, cancel and edit, etc.</p>
<p>I’d say around the B1 level is where you’d get the most mileage out
of changing your phone or computer’s language to your target language,
especially with electronic-device-related vocabulary. Doing it too early
unfortunately results in you depending too much on muscle memory rather
than actually reading and understanding the labels and descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h3>
<p>Russian has a fairly long list of pros that come with it, and its
main cons are those inherent to learning any foreign language: it’s a
hell of a lot of work for an ever-diminishing benefit—namely the ability
to understand someone from another country, another era.</p>
<p>As suboptimalist also mentioned, it’s honestly really difficult to
justify learning any language in the age of real-time translation. Maybe
in the not-so-far future, self-directed language learning will become
something like film criticism: an interesting cultural oddity of the
late twentieth to twenty first century rendered obsolete in the
mainstream, relegated to hobbydom for the most neurotic and pigheaded of
us. But, I’d hazard a guess that if you’re reading this and/or have a
personal website, it is quite likely you identify with that
category.</p>
<p>All of the Russians/Russian-speaking people I’ve met and spoken basic
Russian to are always pleasantly surprised and curious. I said
“здравствуйте” (the formal word to greet someone, whose seemingly
disgusting consonant clusters also act as a filter to any newcomers to
the language—it’s actually not that bad to say, since most of it gets
elided!) to my Russian Uber driver once and she got so excited I was
worried we were going to crash.</p>
<p>I guess it’s because Russian and English are different enough so that
it’s common knowledge to either party that the other must have put in
<em>a lot</em> of effort in knowing even small amounts of the respective
foreign language. Also, the fact that far more Russian speakers are
learning English, than the other way around.</p>
<p>With the invasion of Ukraine looming in the backdrop, who would want
to learn the language of the global black sheep anyways? This has got to
be one of the strangest questions I’ve seen being asked, especially
seeing that one of the most popular languages to learn is Japanese—and I
don’t think Japan is due to make a comeback on the economic world stage
any time soon. It’s not as if learning Ukrainian makes you a morally
better person, either, and yet that is what’s being implied. (If you think this
is the case, I'm sorry. At least you have the rest of your life to change your
mind.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve gone far enough into learning Russian, it’s likely that
another Slavic language will catch your eye… and that’s when you know
that it’s far too late to turn back.</p>
<p>I have to mention, it’s really fascinating to be able to understand
all of this <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NztgXMLwv4A">video</a> (whose host
only speaks in Interslavic, a constructed language based on the common
ground between all modern day Slavic languages) literally only because
of your half-assed knowledge of Russian. I can’t really think of an
English analogue to it—maybe the closest thing would be Esperanto to
Romance language speakers. Almost two years of learning Russian on-and-off,
and all I got was the ability to understand a fake language. That's a 
common sort of trade-off you'll get with language learning, and I'll still
keep at it, because I'm insane.</p>
